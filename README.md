Sidekick lets you transform text using AI.

It comes with a few transformations, and you can add your own just by
describing what you want done in English.

## Usage

On Mac, `Cmd+Shift+E` to pick a transform. Otherwise, `Ctrl+Shift+E`.

## Development

```
npm ci
npm run build
```

Then, navigate to [](chrome://extensions) and load `dist` as an unpacked extension.

For development, use

```
npm run watch
```
